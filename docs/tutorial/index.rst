Welcome to the tutorial on ``braincoder`` and the encoding-decoding framework!

This tutorial will walk you through the basic steps of using ``braincoder`` to
build encoding and decoding models.

We will use the ``braincoder`` package to build a simple encoding model and
then use it to predict the voxel responses to a new stimulus. We will then
build a decoding model and use it to predict the stimulus from the voxel
activations.
